;;; Commentary:

;; This is a derived CC mode for the rust language, partly a
;; copy-and-paste job from
;; http://cc-mode.sourceforge.net/derived-mode-ex.el
;;
;; With further modifications by guesswork and looking through the
;; cc-langs.el file in the CC-mode distribution to get an idea for
;; the keyword/symbol classes.

;; Note: The interface used in this file requires CC Mode 5.30 or
;; later.

;;; Code:

(require 'cc-mode)

;; These are only required at compile time to get the sources for the
;; language constants.  (The cc-fonts require and the font-lock
;; related constants could additionally be put inside an
;; (eval-after-load "font-lock" ...) but then some trickery is
;; necessary to get them compiled.)
